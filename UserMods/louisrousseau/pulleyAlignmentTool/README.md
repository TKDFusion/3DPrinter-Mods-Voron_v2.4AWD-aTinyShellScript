# Pulley Alignment Tool

The GT20 pulley height adjustment on the A/B stepper shafts doesn't match the Voron tool or manual diagrams which are referenced on the stepper housing and stock printed motor mounts.

This little tool lets you align the toothed pulleys on your A/B steppers using the face touching the extrusions; doing it this way works around any differences in metal plate thickness.
